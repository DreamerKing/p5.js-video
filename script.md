* Hello and welcome!
* What is p5.js?
   * p5.js is a new JavaScript library, taking the original goals of Processing, and bringing them to the web.
   
   * The library is intended to introduce creative coding, introduce web development, and provide a tie between the two.  __quick example, with one of each piece coming together?__
   
   * p5.js introduces concepts of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and how they all fit together to let you start creating visual and interactive compositions immediately! __simple, fun graphics fill the screen, quick__
   
   * It also plays nice with the rest of the web.. doing things like letting you access HTML5 features beyond the drawing canvas __some other HTML5 feature?__, and integrating other JS libraries. __quick library example__

* Look, you can draw stuff!
* Look, you can make text!
* Look, you can animate!
* Look, you can make things interactive with html!
   * Button
   * Slider
   * Input box
* A particle system! (flocking?)

* Look, video!

* EVELYN -- closing remarks
   * Much more to come!
   * p5.js is in BETA, and if you like you can help develop it as well as use it! __link to github__
