* Hello and welcome!
* What is p5.js?
   * p5.js is a new JavaScript library, taking the original goals of Processing, and bringing them to the web.
   * The library is intended to introduce creative coding, introduce web development, and provide a tie between the two. Introducing concepts of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. __quick example, with one of each piece coming together?__
   * p5.js lets you start creating visual and interactive compositions immediately! __simple, fun graphics fill the screen, quick__
   * It also plays nice with the rest of the web.. doing things like letting you access HTML5 features beyond canvas __some other HTML5 feature?__, and letting you use other existing libraries with it. __quick library example__

* Look, you can draw stuff!
* Look, you can make text!
* Look, you can animate!
* Look, you can make things interactive with html!
* A particle system! (flocking?)

* (somewhere in there...) p5.js is in BETA, and if you like you can help develop it as well as use it! __link to github__
